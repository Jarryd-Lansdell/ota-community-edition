## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)


All commits in pull requests must contain a `Signed-off-by:` line to indicate that the developer has agreed to the terms of the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) (see [readme](README.adoc) for more details). A simple way to achieve that is to use the `-s` flag of `git commit`.

New pull requests will automatically be checked by the [probot/dco](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/).
